Each `Theorem' is identically numbered as textbook. (Except Chapter 3.5) On the other hand, `Extra Theorem' is things that aren't discussed or proved in textbook.

Theorems in this archive can have some errors. Please come to us if you find some of them, then we will revise them.

Anyway, good luck on your mid-term exam on Friday!
