This work is a theorem archive for `Linear Algebra' subject in Gyeonggi Science High School for the Gifted. It is initiated and mainly written by 황동욱, and being revised by 하석민, 박승원.

Each `Theorem' is identically numbered as textbook. (Except Chapter 3.5) On the other hand, `Extra Theorem' is things that aren't discussed or proved in textbook.

Anyway, good luck on your mid-term exam on Friday!

Theorems in this archive can have some errors. Please come to us if you find some of them, then we will revise them.
