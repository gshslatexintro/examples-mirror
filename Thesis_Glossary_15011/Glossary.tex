	\ding{172} p.34 Explaining significance\newline \textbf{fundamental issue}\newline Explaining the mechanisms of high-temperature superconductors has been a \emph{fundamental issue} after BCS theory proposed in 20th century.& \ding{174} Problem \newline \textbf{ambiguous} \newline For a wave packet with a spread in wavenumber $k$, some \emph{ambiguity} arises in the values of the phase and group velocities because of the spread in $k$, but, for narrow packets in $k$ space, the uncertainties in these values are small \cite{intro1}. \\

	\ding{174} p.37 Problem\newline \textbf{computationally demanding, an alternative approach}\newline Since the simulation methods in the previous researches are \emph{computationally demanding}, \emph{an alternative approach} was needed for this paper.& \ding{175} The present work \newline \textbf{propose, discuss, this paper} \newline \emph{This paper proposes} and \emph{discusses} a definition of internal energy \cite{intro3}.\\

		\ding{174} p.139 Invitation to view results\newline \textbf{as illustrated by Fig. 1}\newline \emph{As illustrated by Fig. 1}, black stripes were observed on the brush along the arc of the commutator.& \ding{174} Invitations to view results \newline \textbf{from Fig. 1 it can be seen that} \newline \emph{From Fig.4 we can see that} the friction coefficients decreased from initial values of 0.48 to about 0.25-0.28 (without current) or 0.34-0.37 (with current) \cite{intro2}.\\
		\hline
		\ding{175} p.140 Specific results in detail\newline \textbf{decrease, noticeably}\newline The wear rate \emph{decreased noticeably} as wear progresses and the value of $\alpha$ increases. & \ding{175} Specific results in detail\newline \textbf{important} \newline The ``thermal shock'' arising as a result of Joule heat release on the contact spot was another \emph{important} factor leading to intensification of the wear of the brush under the action of an electric current. \cite{intro2}.\\
		\hline
		\ding{177} p.144 Problems with results\newline \textbf{not always accurate, hard to control}\newline The measurements of the length were \emph{not always accurate}, since the bottom face of the brush was not always horizontal and this effect was \emph{hard to control}.& \ding{176} Comparisons with other results \newline \textbf{confirm} \newline As already found by Prasad et al. and \emph{confirmed}
		here, both solutions are characterized by high contact pressure
		at the leading edge dropping to zero at the trailing edge, suggesting a lift (separation) at that corner \cite{res3}.\\

		the contact modulus, a composite value obtained by combining
		elastic moduli and poissonâ€™s ratios of both material in contact,
		rather then the approach of this paper \cite{res3}.\\
